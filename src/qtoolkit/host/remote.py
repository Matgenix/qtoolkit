"""
Connect to an SSH server and authenticate to it.  The server's host key
is checked against the system host keys (see `load_system_host_keys`)
and any local host keys (`load_host_keys`).  If the server's hostname
is not found in either set of host keys, the missing host key policy
is used (see `set_missing_host_key_policy`).  The default policy is
to reject the key and raise an `.SSHException`.

Authentication is attempted in the following order of priority:

    - The ``pkey`` or ``key_filename`` passed in (if any)

      - ``key_filename`` may contain OpenSSH public certificate paths
        as well as regular private-key paths; when files ending in
        ``-cert.pub`` are found, they are assumed to match a private
        key, and both components will be loaded. (The private key
        itself does *not* need to be listed in ``key_filename`` for
        this to occur - *just* the certificate.)

    - Any key we can find through an SSH agent
    - Any "id_rsa", "id_dsa" or "id_ecdsa" key discoverable in
      ``~/.ssh/``

      - When OpenSSH-style public certificates exist that match an
        existing such private key (so e.g. one has ``id_rsa`` and
        ``id_rsa-cert.pub``) the certificate will be loaded alongside
        the private key and used for authentication.

    - Plain username/password auth, if a password was given

If a private key requires a password to unlock it, and a password is
passed in, that password will be used to attempt to unlock the key.

:param str hostname: the server to connect to
:param int port: the server port to connect to
:param str username:
    the username to authenticate as (defaults to the current local
    username)
:param str password:
    Used for password authentication; is also used for private key
    decryption if ``passphrase`` is not given.
:param str passphrase:
    Used for decrypting private keys.
:param .PKey pkey: an optional private key to use for authentication
:param str key_filename:
    the filename, or list of filenames, of optional private key(s)
    and/or certs to try for authentication
:param float timeout:
    an optional timeout (in seconds) for the TCP connect
:param bool allow_agent:
    set to False to disable connecting to the SSH agent
:param bool look_for_keys:
    set to False to disable searching for discoverable private key
    files in ``~/.ssh/``
:param bool compress: set to True to turn on compression
:param socket sock:
    an open socket or socket-like object (such as a `.Channel`) to use
    for communication to the target host
:param bool gss_auth:
    ``True`` if you want to use GSS-API authentication
:param bool gss_kex:
    Perform GSS-API Key Exchange and user authentication
:param bool gss_deleg_creds: Delegate GSS-API client credentials or not
:param str gss_host:
    The targets name in the kerberos database. default: hostname
:param bool gss_trust_dns:
    Indicates whether or not the DNS is trusted to securely
    canonicalize the name of the host being connected to (default
    ``True``).
:param float banner_timeout: an optional timeout (in seconds) to wait
    for the SSH banner to be presented.
:param float auth_timeout: an optional timeout (in seconds) to wait for
    an authentication response.
:param dict disabled_algorithms:
    an optional dict passed directly to `.Transport` and its keyword
    argument of the same name."""
